# RBF Image Denoiser

A Python-based image denoising tool that uses Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression to reduce noise from images. This project demonstrates the application of linear programming techniques in denoising images through machine learning algorithms.

## Overview

The RBF Image Denoiser project focuses on removing noise from images using a Radial Basis Function (RBF) regression algorithm. It uses the Numpy Python library for matrix computations and linear programming techniques to enhance the quality of images. This denoiser works effectively on various types of noise such as Gaussian noise.

The goal of the project is to provide a functional tool for improving image quality, particularly for images with visible noise in various formats.
